# Team Project: Equities (and other assets) vs the S&amp;P 500

Group members: Jipeng Chen, Olivia Chen, Afaqul Haque, Diane Martin, Nikki Reyes

The goal of this project is to import data from an online source and process the data using various python libraries. Your group will choose five distinct equities or assets in different classes. A regression analysis on each of the asset against the S&P 500 will determine if there is any correlation. Submit the final project as a single Jupyter notebook file (.ipynb).
